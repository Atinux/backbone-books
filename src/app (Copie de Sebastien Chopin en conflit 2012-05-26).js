Test taking is a skill apart from learning course material, a skill every student must acquire in order to survive. Test-Taking Strategies is the book for anyone who has ever dreaded an exam. Strategies for taking every kind of test are dealt with—objective tests (multiple choice, true/false, matching), essay tests, and oral exams. The authors also offer help for handling anxiety, explaining relaxation and desensitization techniques that help students control nervousness and keep it from detracting from performance. There are tips for managing time during the test, knowing when to guess, and for pulling answers out of your memory even when the question drew a blank at first glance. Essay tests and oral exams are particularly gruesome for most students, and until now there has been very little advice for handling such tests. Test-Taking Strategies includes plenty of advice for developing ideas while under pressure.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"029919194X"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780299191948"}],"pageCount":128,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Study Aids"],"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://bks2.books.google.fr/books?id=h9LJHmgC06gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://bks2.books.google.fr/books?id=h9LJHmgC06gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=h9LJHmgC06gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=h9LJHmgC06gC&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/about/Test_Taking_Strategies.html?id=h9LJHmgC06gC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"FR","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"FR","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/download/Test_Taking_Strategies-sample-epub.acsm?id=h9LJHmgC06gC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/download/Test_Taking_Strategies-sample-pdf.acsm?id=h9LJHmgC06gC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE"}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"6EkuAAAAYAAJ","etag":"nZ1f+37+LcM","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6EkuAAAAYAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The test","subtitle":"or Parties tried by the acts","authors":["Calvin Colton"],"publishedDate":"1843","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"HARVARD:HX2W5H"}],"pageCount":16,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"contentVersion":"full-1.0.0","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=6EkuAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=6EkuAAAAYAAJ&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/about/The_test.html?id=6EkuAAAAYAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"FR","saleability":"FREE","isEbook":true},"accessInfo":{"country":"FR","viewability":"ALL_PAGES","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":true,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","pdf":{"downloadLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/download/The_test.pdf?id=6EkuAAAAYAAJ&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=pdf&sig=ACfU3U3HL9eqNL4gS0d8l9ckLYZabMY-7Q&source=gbs_api"},"accessViewStatus":"FULL_PUBLIC_DOMAIN"}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"lW0-RAAACAAJ","etag":"Hajtji/kfGg","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lW0-RAAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Test","authors":["Mary Tappan Wright"],"publishedDate":"2009-12","description":"General Books publication date: 2009 Original publication date: 1905 Original Publisher: Scribner Subjects: Fiction / General Fiction / Classics Fiction / Historical Fiction / Literary Fiction / Short Stories Notes: This is an OCR reprint of the original rare book.

Anyone who feels that TDD is “Too Damn Difficult” will appreciate this book. Design Driven Testingshows that, by combining a forward-thinking development process with cutting-edge automation, testing can be a finely targeted, business-driven, rewarding effort. In other words, you'll learn how to test smarter, not harder. Applies a feedback-driven approach to each stage of the project lifecycle. Illustrates a lightweight and effective approach using a core subset of UML. Follows a real-life example project using Java and Flex/ActionScript. Presents bonus chapters for advanced DDTers covering unit-test antipatterns (and their opposite, “test-conscious” design patterns), and showing how to create your own test transformation templates in Enterprise Architect. What you'll learn Create unit and behavioral tests using JUnit, NUnit, FlexUnit. Generate acceptance tests for all usage paths through use case thread expansion. Generate requirement tests for functional requirements. Run complex acceptance tests across the enterprise. Isolate individual control points for self-contained unit/behavioral tests. Apply Behavior Driven Development frameworks like JBehave and NBehave Who this book is for Design Driven Testingshould appeal to developers, project managers, testers, business analysts, architects...in fact anyone who builds software that needs to be tested. While equally applicable on both large and small projects,Design Driven Testingis especially helpful to those developers who need to verify their software against formal requirements. Such developers will benefit greatly from the rational and disciplined approach espoused by the authors.

Had he put too much emphasis on work and spent too little time with his family? Determined to leave something far more valuable than money to his six children, Paul instructs his lawyers o create an unusual last will and testament. This unorthodox will, which stipulates that the lion's share of Paul's two- billion dollar estate be given to the heirs who pass \"the test\", was Paul's last hope of creating a lasting legacy by inspiring his children to give back to society and embrace a code of moral values. The six children - Rory, Frank, Dan, Monica, Carl and Ashley - have only one year to make a difference. But what a difference one year will make. Before these six very different siblings can complete the test, they'll be forced to face their personal demons, and the incredibly evil influence that could claim one of their own.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1608090035"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781608090037"}],"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":12,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://bks8.books.google.fr/books?id=CsVHbwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://bks8.books.google.fr/books?id=CsVHbwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=CsVHbwAACAAJ&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&cd=17&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=CsVHbwAACAAJ&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/about/The_Test.html?id=CsVHbwAACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"FR","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"FR","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","accessViewStatus":"NONE"}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"h1tLZi5A_vQC","etag":"jWLdM6tR1mM","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/h1tLZi5A_vQC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The GRE Test for Dummies","authors":["Michelle Rose Gilman","Suzee Vlk","Veronica Saydak"],"publisher":"For Dummies","publishedDate":"2009-03-09","description":"A totally effective and surprisingly fun guide to the Graduate Record Examination In Fall 2007, the GRE Program is planning to implement significant changes to the verbal measure, quantitative measure, and analytical writing sections of the GRE.

Dean Adams"],"publisher":"Springer","publishedDate":"2003","description":"Design and test are considered jointly in this book since knowledge of one without the other is insufficient for the task of having high quality memories. Knowledge of memory design is required to understand test. An understanding of test is required to have effective built-in self-test implementations. A poor job can be done on any of these pieces resulting in a memory that passes test but which is not actually good. The relentless press of Moore's law drives more and more bits onto a single chip. The large number of bits means that methods that were \"gotten away with\" in the past will no longer be sufficient. Because the number of bits is so large, fine nuances of fails that were rarely seen previously now will happen regularly on most chips. These subtle fails must be caught or else quality will suffer severely. Are memory applications more critical than they have been in the past? Yes, but even more critical is the number of designs and the sheer number of bits on each design. It is assured that catastrophes, which were avoided in the past because memories were small, will easily occur if the design and test engineers do not do their jobs very carefully.

Rikli","C. Jessie Jones"],"publisher":"Human Kinetics Publishers","publishedDate":"2001-01-01","description":"Although physical fitness has traditionally been associated with the young through the middle-aged, it is most critical for those in their senior years. Older adults require adequate strength, flexibility, and endurance to accomplish even ordinary, everyday tasks. Up until now, most physical fitness tests have been geared to younger audiences. The Senior Fitness Test is an answer to the need for a simple, easy-to-use battery of test items that assess the functional fitness of older adults. The test is safe and enjoyable for older adults, it meets scientific standards for reliability and validity, and it has accompanying performance norms based on actual performance scores of over 7,000 men and women between the ages of 60 and 94. The Senior Fitness Test Manualprovides the theoretical base for the test. It also includes the developmental procedures and provides complete information on administering and scoring the test and providing feedback to test participants about their results. It also includes instructions on organizing and testing groups of older adults. The appendix has reproducible sample forms, charts, tables, and posters for instructors to use in their programs. Chapter 1introduces the test and explains why fitness is important for older adults. Chapter 2establishes the conceptual background for the test, describes how it relates to traditional theories and models describing physical decline in later years, and presents a brief overview of the test items. Chapter 3contains the scientific documentation for the test's validity, reliability, and performance standards. Chapter 4includes a list of procedures and issues that need to be addressed prior to testing, along with sample instruction sheets, forms, and equipment lists to use in planning for the test. Also included are proper warm-up and pretest instructions that should be given to the participants prior to testing and descriptions of the official testing and scoring protocols. Chapter 5explains how to interpret test results and how to use the information to motivate participants to increase their activity levels and improve their performances. The Senior Fitness Test helps professionals not only motivate older adults, but also assess the major physiological components of functional capacity so that emerging weaknesses can be detected and treated before causing serious functional limitations.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0736033564"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780736033565"}],"pageCount":161,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Health & Fitness"],"contentVersion":"0.1.0.0.preview.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://bks0.books.google.fr/books?id=LoY62mRXYzYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://bks0.books.google.fr/books?id=LoY62mRXYzYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=LoY62mRXYzYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&cd=24&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=LoY62mRXYzYC&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/about/Senior_fitness_test_manual.html?id=LoY62mRXYzYC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"FR","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"FR","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE"}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"dRO0jYKLT2sC","etag":"K5XEM38Qlu8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/dRO0jYKLT2sC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Test Your IQ","subtitle":"400 Questions to Boost Your Brainpower","authors":["Philip Carter"],"publisher":"Kogan Page Ltd","publishedDate":"2009-10-28","description":"Test Your IQ contains IQ test questions written and compiled by IQ-test experts, complete with a guide to assessing individual performance.

But unit testing has moved far beyond eXtreme Programming; it is now common in many different types of application development. Unit tests help ensure low-level code correctness, reduce software development cycle time, improve developer productivity, and produce more robust software. Until now, there was little documentation available on unit testing, and most sources addressed specific frameworks and specific languages, rather than explaining the use of unit testing as a language-independent, standalone development methodology. This invaluable new book covers the theory and background of unit test frameworks, offers step-by-step instruction in basic unit test development, provides useful code examples in both Java and C++, and includes details on some of the most commonly used frameworks today from the XUnit family, including JUnit for Java, CppUnit for C++, and NUnit for .NET.

That is the mission of this book. The \"Handbook of Test Development\" brings together well-known scholars and test-development practitioners to present chapters on all aspects of test development. Each chapter contributor is not only a recognized expert with an academic and research background in their designated topic, each one has also had hands-on experience in various aspects of test development. This 32-chapter volume is organized into six sections: foundations, content, item development, test design, test production and administration, and post-test activities. The handbook provides extensive treatment of such important but unrecognized topics as contracting for testing services, item banking, designing tests for small testing program, and writing technical reports. The handbook is based on the \"Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing,\" which serve as the foundation for sound test development practice. These chapters also suggest best test development practices and highlight methods to improve test validity evidence. This book is appropriate for graduate courses and seminars that deal with test development and usage, professional testing services and credentialing agencies, state and local boards of education, and academic libraries serving these groups.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0805852654"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780805852653"}],"pageCount":778,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Education"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":5,"contentVersion":"1.0.0.0.preview.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://bks2.books.google.fr/books?id=CwxFhehJllwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://bks2.books.google.fr/books?id=CwxFhehJllwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=CwxFhehJllwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&cd=27&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=CwxFhehJllwC&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/about/Handbook_of_test_development.html?id=CwxFhehJllwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"FR","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"FR","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE"}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ULf1H5q-Xj0C","etag":"7Sf3HFDowfE","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ULf1H5q-Xj0C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Ace the Corporate Personality Test","authors":["Edward Hoffman"],"publisher":"McGraw-Hill Professional","publishedDate":"2001","description":"Virtually everyone looking for corporate work today must submit to a personality test.

Automated testing is a cornerstone of agile development. An effective testing strategy will deliver new functionality more aggressively, accelerate user feedback, and improve quality. However, for many developers, creating effective automated tests is a unique and unfamiliar challenge. xUnit Test Patterns is the definitive guide to writing automated tests using xUnit, the most popular unit testing framework in use today. Agile coach and test automation expert Gerard Meszaros describes 68 proven patterns for making tests easier to write, understand, and maintain. He then shows you how to make them more robust and repeatable--and far more cost-effective. Loaded with information, this book feels like three books in one. The first part is a detailed tutorial on test automation that covers everything from test strategy to in-depth test coding. The second part, a catalog of 18 frequently encountered \"test smells,\" provides trouble-shooting guidelines to help you determine the root cause of problems and the most applicable patterns. The third part contains detailed descriptions of each pattern, including refactoring instructions illustrated by extensive code samples in multiple programming languages. Topics covered include Writing better tests--and writing them faster The four phases of automated tests: fixture setup, exercising the system under test, result verification, and fixture teardown Improving test coverage by isolating software from its environment using Test Stubs and Mock Objects Designing software for greater testability Using test \"smells\" (including code smells, behavior smells, and project smells) to spot problems and know when and how to eliminate them Refactoring tests for greater simplicity, robustness, and execution speed This book will benefit developers, managers, and testers working with any agile or conventional development process, whether doing test-driven development or writing the tests last. While the patterns and smells are especially applicable to all members of the xUnit family, they also apply to next-generation behavior-driven development frameworks such as RSpec and JBehave and to other kinds of test automation tools, including recorded test tools and data-driven test tools such as Fit and FitNesse.

Brennan"],"publisher":"Springer Verlag","publishedDate":"2004","description":"Test equating methods are used with many standardized tests in education and psychology to ensure that scores from multiple test forms can be used interchangeably. In recent years, researchers from the education, psychology, and statistics communities have contributed to the rapidly growing statistical and psychometric methodologies used in test equating. This book provides an introduction to test equating which both discusses the most frequently used equating methodologies and covers many of the practical issues involved. This second edition expands upon the coverage of the first edition by providing a new chapter on test scaling and a second on test linking. Test scaling is the process of developing score scales that are used when scores on standardized tests are reported. In test linking, scores from two or more tests are related to one another. Linking has received much recent attention, due largely to investigations of linking similarly named tests from different test publishers or tests constructed for different purposes. The expanded coverage in the second edition also includes methodology for using polytomous item response theory in equating. The themes of the second edition include: * the purposes of equating, scaling and linking and their practical context * data collection designs * statistical methodology * designing reasonable and useful equating, scaling, and linking studies * importance of test development and quality control processes to equating * equating error, and the underlying statistical assumptions for equating \"Given the perennial debates about academic standards and grade inflation, it is my view that tools such as those described in this book should be adopted much more widely by the academic community than they are at present.

The ever-increasing complexity and functional speed of microelectronic circuits now containing tens of millions of transistors demand appropriate and rigorous test engineering activities during development and production. Test engineering must also be more closely interwoven with microelectronic design. An understanding of circuit test engineering is vital to any student desiring a career involving any stage in the design or manufacture of integrated circuits.Taking a three-pronged approach - dealing with test engineering from traditional-test, design and manufacturing view-points - Integrated Circuit Test Engineering encapsulates the subject as it stands today. After an introduction covering background from basic testing rules to trends in technology, the reader learns about:â€¢ fabrication processes; â€¢ a diverse and complete range of detailed tests and procedures calculated to teach you all the tests you will require and how to choose which one(s) to use; â€¢ how to design for testability; â€¢ fault simulation; â€¢ automatic test equipment and â€¢ the economics of testing. From a practical perspective, the text includes:â€¢ A range of worked examples and exercises together with well-organized references and bibliography to aid further enquiry. â€¢ An introduction to various software such as MATLABÂ® and Spice explaining their use in testing together with that of IEEE-standard hardware-description languages VerilogÂ®-HDL and VHDL. â€¢ A series of experiments based on material which can be freely downloaded from springeronline.com instructing you in the construction of a hardware test arrangement for MS Windows PCs (functionality, schematic and printed-circuit-board layout)with Visual Basic programs to drive the experiments. Integrated Circuit Test Engineering provides a thorough-going and illuminating introduction to test engineering in analogue, digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. This text is a valuable practical learning tool for advanced undergraduate and graduate electronic engineering students, an excellent teaching resource for their tutors and a useful guide for the practising electronic engineer.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1846280230"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781846280238"}],"pageCount":362,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"contentVersion":"1.0.0.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://bks0.books.google.fr/books?id=0PwCmrk3Y6YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://bks0.books.google.fr/books?id=0PwCmrk3Y6YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=0PwCmrk3Y6YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&cd=37&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=0PwCmrk3Y6YC&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/about/Integrated_circuit_test_engineering.html?id=0PwCmrk3Y6YC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"FR","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"FR","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","pdf":{"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/download/Integrated_circuit_test_engineering-sample-pdf.acsm?id=0PwCmrk3Y6YC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE"}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"9HRodACJLOoC","etag":"C1T+q1L0F+E","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9HRodACJLOoC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Boundary-scan test","subtitle":"a practical approach","authors":["Harry Bleeker","Peter van den Eijnden","Frans de Jong"],"publisher":"Springer","publishedDate":"1993","description":"This new book will act an introduction to as well as a practical guide to Boundary-Scan testing. The ever increasing miniaturization of digital electronic components is hampering the conventional testing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) by means of bed-of-nails fixtures. Basically this is caused by the very high scale of integration of ICs, through which packages with hundreds of pins at very small pitches of down to a fraction of a millimeter, have become available. As a consequence, the trace distances between the copper tracks on a printed circuit board came down to the same value. Not only have the required small physical dimensions of the test nails made conventional testing unfeasible, the complexity to provide test signals for many hundreds of test nails has grown beyond manageable limits. A new board test methodology has to be invented. Following the evolution in the IC test technology, Boundary-Scan testing has become the new approach to PCB testing. By taking precautions in the design of the IC (design for testability), testing on a PCB level could be simplified to a great extent. This condition has been essential for the success of the introduction of a Boundary-Scan Test (BST) at board level. Since Boundary-Scan testing involves the whole PCB life cycle, it is more than just the introduction of a new design technology. It is an integral production approach which will aid top management in their goal of a successful global strategy for their business. This book will aid a company to introduce the Boundary-Scan Test. IC design and test engineers alike will find the book an important introduction and guide to using the Boundary-Scan Test in their work. Engineering managers can also use this book to gain an insight to the impact that the Boundary-Scan Test will make on their organisation.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0792392965"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780792392965"}],"pageCount":225,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"contentVersion":"0.0.1.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://bks1.books.google.fr/books?id=9HRodACJLOoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://bks1.books.google.fr/books?id=9HRodACJLOoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=9HRodACJLOoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&cd=38&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.fr/books?id=9HRodACJLOoC&dq=test&ie=ISO-8859-1&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/about/Boundary_scan_test.html?id=9HRodACJLOoC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"FR","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"FR","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/download/Boundary_scan_test-sample-epub.acsm?id=9HRodACJLOoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.fr/books/download/Boundary_scan_test-sample-pdf.acsm?id=9HRodACJLOoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE"}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"CRBkgwUu9-8C","etag":"fZSJyjW+WpA","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CRBkgwUu9-8C","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Brockport physical fitness test manual","authors":["Joseph P.
